# It is RTG - Random Traffic Generator
This traffic generator is designed to hide visited sites from the provider or an outside observer by generating random traffic.
***How it works?***
The page contains a script.
The script establishes in a random sequence a connection with random nodes (listed separately) for a random time, thereby significantly complicating traffic analysis.
Also, this generator can allow you to bypass the timing of the attack due to the presence of constant random network activity.
To start, open the .html file in a browser, select your language (Russian or English) and follow the prompts.
